        #Sol_Venus_name = Venus^N
        #Sol_Venus_desc = This beautiful object is the second planet of our neighborhood. Named after the goddess of love and beauty, Venus is one of the brightest objects in our night sky. Though she is considered a sister planet to Earth, Venus has no satellites (moons) and is alone in her orbit around our star.
        #Sol_Venus_Biome1 = Midlands
        #Sol_Venus_Biome2 = Mountains
        #Sol_Venus_Biome3 = Canyons
        #Sol_Venus_Biome4 = Lakshmi Planum
        #Sol_Venus_Biome5 = Fortuna Tessera
        #Sol_Venus_Biome6 = Volcanic Rise
        #Sol_Venus_Biome7 = Highlands
        #Sol_Venus_Biome8 = Lowlands

        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_VenusSrfLanded1 = The red temperature alarm light is blinking on and off. The spacecraft may or may not be melting right now.
        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_VenusSrfLanded2 = What a wonderful place to stage a faked Moon landing.
        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_VenusInSpace = Below you is a nearly flat white-yellow rolling sphere. The cloud formations are barely apparent in visible light. You know that the surface is much less serene.
        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_VenusFlyingHigh = The clouds are gradually approaching. The beautiful sky reminds you of Earth's sky.
        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_VenusFlyingLow = Passing through the clouds, the lighting becomes very much darker and it takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust. You can just about make out the orange-grey surface.

        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_VenusSrfLanded1 = After only a few seconds on the surface, you worry that your space suit may not be up to the task of keeping you from burning to a crisp.
        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_VenusSrfLanded2 = No time for big speeches. You're here to pick up rocks.
        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_VenusSrfLanded3 = Every surface is coated in a dull, flat, orange light. The atmosphere is so thick it's like looking through water.
        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_VenusSrfLanded4 = There are no shadows, and you can not see the Sun. The light is very dim, like twilight on Earth.
        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_VenusFlyingHigh = This is a rather precarious situation.
        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_VenusFlyingLow = You're falling so slowly you'd probably be fine.
        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_VenusInSpace = "...And maybe they've seen us... and welcome us allllll, yeah. With so many lightyears to go... and things to be fo-ou-ound, I'm sure that we all miss her sooooo... It's the Final Countdown! Dananaaaaa naaaa! Danana na naaaa! Dannana naaaa! The final countdown, woah, oh!" A few minutes later you hear Mission Control struggling to keep from laughing.

        #Sol_Science_SurfaceSample_VenusSrfLanded = The grey-orange rocks are very rounded due to wind erosion. The surface is cracked.

        #Sol_Science_TempScan_VenusSrfLanded1 = The thermometer has melted and then boiled.
        #Sol_Science_TempScan_VenusSrfLanded2 = The temperature is hot enough to melt lead.
        #Sol_Science_TempScan_VenusFlyingLow = Venus is very clearly the hottest planet in the Solar System.
        #Sol_Science_TempScan_VenusFlyingHigh = The temperature is only a little warmer than Earth sea level here. In fact if it weren't for the poisonous acid in the atmosphere and the lack of oxygen, this might be one of the most Earthlike places in the solar system (other than Earth, of course.)

        #Sol_Science_SeismicScan_VenusSrfLanded = The planet is geologically dead for the most part.

        #Sol_Science_GravityScan_VenusInSpace = The sensor provides a map of the surface despite the extremely thick clouds blocking the surface from view.

        #Sol_Science_AtmoAnalysis_VenusSrfLanded = Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, and Sulphuric Acid. Not fun stuff to breathe, certainly not at these temperatures.
        #Sol_Science_AtmoAnalysis_VenusFlyingHigh = Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen. A bit of acids in the air. You wouldn't want to breathe the stuff, but you could probably go outside and be fine.

        #Sol_Science_MysteryGoo_VenusSrfLanded = The Goo has boiled away leaving behind a black, burnt residue.
        #Sol_Science_MysteryGoo_VenusInSpace = The Goo has become rubbery and bounces around the container.
        #Sol_Science_MysteryGoo_VenusFlyingHigh = The Goo turns blue.
        #Sol_Science_MysteryGoo_VenusFlyingLow = The goo is beginning to boil.

        #Sol_Science_MML_VenusSrfLanded1 = The crushing pressure of the atmosphere is causing some of the materials to crystallize rapidly.
        #Sol_Science_MML_VenusSrfLanded2 = Some of the samples boil, others melt. The lead sample is now coating the bottom of the bay, and the plastic coating the wires has melted to cover the top of the lead pool. One sample solidifies, against all known laws of nature.
