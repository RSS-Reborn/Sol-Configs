        #Sol_Ganymede_desc = The largest moon in our Solar System, Ganymede is the third Galilean moon around Jupiter. Ganymede has a liquid iron core which produces a unique, yet meager, magnetosphere.

        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_GanymedeInSpace = The biggest moon in the solar system. Here it is. Ice and rock and plenty of it.
        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_GanymedeSrfLanded = You think about ice fishing here, but then try to find Europa in the sky out the window instead.

        #Sol_Science_EVAReport_GanymedeSrfLanded = The brown surface is hard, but at least the gravity is high enough to keep manoeuvring from being too difficult.
