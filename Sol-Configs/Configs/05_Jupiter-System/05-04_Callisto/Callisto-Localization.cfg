        #Sol_Callisto_name = Callisto
        #Sol_Callisto_desc = The fourth of the Galilean moons, Callisto is the second-largest moon in the Jovian system. Callisto has a very thin atmosphere comprised mostly of carbon dioxide and has a rather intense ionosphere.
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome1 = Lowlands
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome2 = Cratered Midlands
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome3 = Cratered Highlands
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome4 = Asgard Crater
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome5 = Valhalla Crater
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome6 = Young Craters
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome7 = Old Craters
        #Sol_Callisto_Biome8 = Poles

        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_CallistoInSpace = That's a LOT of craters. It may very well be the most cratered moon in the entire solar system. You look at your Encyclopedia Galactica. It says that it is in fact the most cratered moon in the Solar System.
        #Sol_Science_CrewReport_CallistoSrfLaned = Callisto must feel really left out, not being involved in the 1:2:4 resonance that Io, Europa, and Ganymede have.
